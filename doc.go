/*Package sudoku ...

This project is developed as an means for me to learn Go.

My goals are to build realistic software - so not in a quick and dirty way
like you would to solve Project Euler problems, but in a way that you would
as part of a long-lived real-life project.

I'm not trying to make the fastest solution, but to model some real-world
strategies and most importantly to explore language features.
